# Introduction
   

## What did we do?
Sample preparation is key to accurate quantitative results from a chemical assay and understanding mushroom metabolic processes. The insights gained from these analyses depend upon a thoughtful sampling preparation workflow tuned to extract and preserve the analyte(s). Homogenization is often overlooked because the analytes are assumed to be stable, given appropriate GMP handling and related SOPs. As a result, hand grinding, food processors, coffee grinders, or other milling methods that provide less control are commonplace in a laboratory setting. However, many biomolecules of interest are thermally labile and consumed during sample preparation. As a result, instrumentation with less emphasis on controlling experimental variables could yield inaccurate results. We used a Fritsch P11 bladed mill to prepare various functional mushrooms for extraction as a convenient means of controlling sample particle size, mill time, and blade speed.

# Milling and extraction

Milling is a critical step in any extraction process and is used to reduce the particle size of the sample. Milling has been shown to affect protein solubility, resulting in sample loss due to absorption on the milled material or evaporation. We used a Fritsch P11 bladed mill to prepare the mushroom extracts to produce a homogeneous powder without altering the chemical composition or structure of the mushroom extract. Although the milling strategy used here was developed for mushroom samples, it can also be applied to other substrates. 

## How did we do it?
Dried samples of Lion's Mane, Reishi, Turkey Tail, Cordyceps, and Chaga mushrooms were analyzed for volatile chemical constituents by GCMS by following a simple sample preparation procedure involving milling and solvent-based extraction. Mushroom samples were weighed, sectioned using a razor, ground using the P11 mill at different times/speeds, and placed into sealable plastic bags. A selection of each batch was taken for particle size analysis. The milling technique was varied to explore the effects of homogenization on biomolecule concentration in the mushroom extracts. Samples were milled between 600-1200 RPM for 10-30 seconds to produce small material particles appropriate for extraction. The extraction procedure, including sonication assistance, time, and particle size made from the P11 mill, was evaluated through analyte recovery. Samples were extracted according to procedures employed in the literature for functional mushroom extraction along with less commonly used solvent combinations.

## Milling time and speed
Many biomolecules in botanical material are unstable to the heat produced through bladed milling. For this reason, and because the material is pulverized relatively quickly, milling times are generally kept short given a mass of mushrooms. Frictional heat and analyte degradation is minimized by reducing the speed of the blade. Because of this, bladeless mills (such as bead/ball) are a popular method of mushroom maceration. That being said, bladed mills are more straightforward, cleaner, and versatile and remain a staple for foodstuff sample preparation.

## Solvent extraction
A plethora of solvents is used to solubilize small organic molecules in plant material, depending on the needs of the analysis. Perhaps the most common formulations (a combination of water, alcohol, and a small amount of acid) are focused on partitioning polar organic molecules into an extraction solvent, which is filtered and diluted for analysis (other steps may include centrifugation, buffer salts, preconcentration, liquid-liquid extraction, etc.).
