# DRAFT - Hierarchical Chemical Classification with ClassyFire

# Copilot Description

ClassyFire is a web-based tool designed to automatically classify chemical compounds into a hierarchical taxonomy based on their chemical structures. It uses a rule-based approach to assign compounds to various chemical classes, making it easier for researchers to organize and analyze large datasets of chemical information¹.

Here are some key features of ClassyFire:

1. **Hierarchical Classification**: ClassyFire organizes compounds into a multi-level hierarchy, from broad categories like "organic compounds" to more specific classes such as "alkaloids" or "flavonoids"¹.

2. **Automated Annotation**: The tool can automatically annotate large datasets, saving significant time and effort compared to manual classification¹.

3. **Integration with Other Tools**: ClassyFire can be integrated with other cheminformatics tools and databases, enhancing its utility in various research workflows¹.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**: It provides an easy-to-use web interface, making it accessible to researchers without extensive computational expertise¹.

ClassyFire is particularly useful in fields like metabolomics, where researchers often deal with complex mixtures of chemical compounds and need efficient ways to classify and analyze them.
