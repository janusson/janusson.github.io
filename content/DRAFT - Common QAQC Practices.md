Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) practices are essential for maintaining accuracy and reliability in laboratory analyses. Here are some common practices:

1. **Calibration and Standardization**:
    
    - Regularly calibrate instruments using certified reference materials (CRMs) or standard solutions.
    - Create calibration curves to relate instrument responses to analyte concentrations.
    - Verify instrument performance using QC standards.
2. **Method Validation**:
    
    - Validate analytical methods before routine use.
    - Assess parameters such as accuracy, precision, linearity, and sensitivity.
    - Document validation results and update as needed.
3. **Sample Preparation Controls**:
    
    - Use blanks (matrix without analytes) to check for contamination during sample preparation.
    - Include spiked samples (with known analyte concentrations) to assess recovery.
4. **Internal QC Samples**:
    
    - Analyze internal QC samples (prepared in-house) alongside real samples.
    - Monitor precision (repeatability) and accuracy (bias) using control charts.
5. **External Proficiency Testing**:
    
    - Participate in external proficiency programs to compare results with other labs.
    - Identify areas for improvement based on inter-laboratory comparisons.
6. **Replicate Analyses**:
    
    - Perform duplicate or triplicate analyses to assess precision.
    - Calculate relative standard deviation (RSD) to quantify variability.
7. **Instrument Maintenance and Verification**:
    
    - Regularly maintain and verify instrument performance.
    - Clean optics, replace consumables, and perform system suitability tests.
