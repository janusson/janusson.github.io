Investing in **Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** is a smart and strategic move for Canadian investors looking to diversify their investment portfolio. With several ETFs listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and available in Canadian dollars, investors can avoid currency exchange fees. ETFs offer versatility and appeal to both beginners and seasoned investors. Even the legendary investor Warren Buffet appreciates their simplicity and consistent returns. Each ETF functions as a diversified portfolio, providing a solid foundation for your investment strategy and simplifying fine-tuning and rebalancing.  In this article, we’ll go into ETF basics and how they differ from mutual funds, explore the best ETF providers in Canada, and how to use asset allocation principles to build your Canadian ETF portfolio.

## ETF essentials

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)** are securities traded on stock exchanges (hence the term “exchange-traded”). They function as “funds,” similar to mutual funds, which means they represent a large pool of money contributed by multiple investors. Like mutual funds, ETFs hold portfolios of assets, including stocks, commodities, or bonds. Combining the flexibility of stock trading with the diversification and risk management of mutual funds, ETFs experience price fluctuations throughout the day as they are bought and sold or as the value of the underlying assets change. Their appeal lies in offering diversified securities with lower fees compared to mutual funds and fewer broker commissions than purchasing individual assets directly.

## ETFs versus mutual funds

Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are significantly more cost-effective. This is important because fees directly impact long-term returns. In Canada, the average mutual fund charges an annual management expense ratio (MER) of approximately 1.5%, whereas ETFs are substantially cheaper, with an average expense ratio of 0.15%. Note that the expense is taken out of the funds resources so you don't need to directly pay your ETF provider. Instead, the fees that are subtracted from the ETF impact the annual return. A compelling reason to switch to ETFs from mutual funds lies in their lower costs which translate to higher profits for investors. Another compelling reason for the widespread adoption of ETFs is that approximately 90% of mutual fund managers consistently fail to outperform a straightforward, low-cost passive index ETF.

## Top ETF Providers in Canada

When it comes to selecting ETF providers in Canada, investors have several reputable companies to choose from. Some of the top contenders include:

- **Vanguard Canada**: Vanguard is renowned for its low-cost index funds, making it a preferred choice for investors seeking cost-effective solutions. Their ETFs consistently offer competitive fees, aligning with their investor-friendly philosophy.
- [Vanguard Canada](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/home)
- **BMO Asset Management**: BMO’s ETFs stand out for their innovative approach and diverse range of offerings. Whether you’re a conservative or aggressive investor, BMO provides options that cater to different investment strategies.

- **BlackRock Canada**: BlackRock’s iShares ETFs cover a wide spectrum of market segments. They offer flexibility and accessibility for investors looking to tap into various asset classes.

Vanguard Canada ETFs stand out for their low fees and investor-friendly approach while BMO offers plenty of variety and competitive pricing. Interestingly, BlackRock Canada charged Canadian customers high fees for years until Vanguard’s arrival prompted them to reduce fees—a phenomenon known as “the Vanguard effect.” As well, it’s worth noting that BlackRock has faced criticism due to competing interests, particularly in the context of its closed-end funds. Activist hedge funds, such as Saba Capital Management, have raised concerns about governance practices and shareholder rights within BlackRock-managed funds. As an investor, carefully evaluating the MERs of similar funds and considering the fund providers’ outside influences is important when choosing between ETFs.

## Index Funds

Index funds are simply funds (including ETFs) that mirror well-known indices, providing investors with returns based on overall market performance. These **passive** index funds aim to passively track an index, minimizing **active** trading in the fund. Several passive ETFs are available that track the same or similar indices, so your choice may be determined by the performance, provider, or expense of the ETF. Stock indices represent a basket of stocks that track the overall performance of a specific market, sector, or asset class. They serve as benchmarks, allowing investors to gauge market trends and compare their portfolio returns. The most common type of equity index is a market-cap weighted index in which the amount of each stock is held according to its float-adjusted market value (the total number of shares available multiplied by stock price). Here are some key equity indices:

1. **S&P 500**: This widely followed index represents the top 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. Encapsulating approximately 80% of the market, it serves as a benchmark for the overall health of the U.S. stock market. Over the long run, it has been one of the best performing indices.

2. **S&P/TSX 60 Composite**: In Canada, this index includes the 60 largest and most actively traded stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). It’s a common choice for Canadian equity exposure.

3. **MSCI World Index**: Unlike regional indices, the MSCI World Index covers stocks from around the globe. It provides a broader perspective on global equity markets.

4. **Other Global Indices**: Beyond these, there are numerous indices covering international stocks (FTSE Developed Europe Index, FTSE Emerging Markets Index), bonds (Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, U.S. Treasury Bond Index), real estate (FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Global Real Estate Index, MSCI Global Real Estate Index), commodities (S&P GSCI Index, Bloomberg Commodity Index), and more. ETFs that track these indices allow investors to access a diverse range of global assets.

## More notes on Indices:
S&P 500 ETFs offer exposure to large-cap U.S. equities and are a staple in many portfolios due to their broad representation of the U.S. market. S&P/TSX 60 ETFs, on the other hand, provide a focus on Canadian equities, allowing investors to tap into the top 60 large-cap companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which are beneficial for those seeking exposure to the Canadian market.  Incorporating ETFs that track the FTSE Developed Markets Index can add a layer of diversification by including companies from Europe, Australia, and other developed regions, thus spreading the geographic risk. Emerging Markets ETFs are suitable for investors looking to benefit from the growth potential of developing economies, although they come with higher volatility and risk. Real-Estate ETFs can serve as a hedge against inflation and offer a stable income through dividends, making them a valuable component of a diversified portfolio. Lastly, Gold and Commodities ETFs can provide a non-correlated asset class that often performs differently than stocks and bonds, offering a potential safe haven during severe market downturns or periods of high inflation. Analogously, there are bond indices which ladder bonds from various sources and terms to maturity which provide security and stability to a portfolio.

Not all ETFs track specific indices. Some ETFs are actively managed, focusing on factors like dividend yield, value, or momentum of the underlying assets. These actively managed ETFs can select holdings from a broader universe of multiple indices or narrow their focus to a single index. Passive index funds, on the other hand, offer benefits such as low costs, simplicity, and predictable returns. While active funds may outperform index funds, they tend to be more expensive due to management fees. Lastly, investing in index funds for bonds, real estate, or commodities through different ETFs provides exposure without the need to construct the portfolio manually.

## Effective asset allocation through ETFs

**Asset allocation** is a method for managing the risk and return profile of your portfolio. The guiding principle is to avoid putting all your investments in one place. This involves distributing your investments across various asset classes, including stocks (equities), bonds (fixed income), and alternative investments like real estate and commodities. By adhering to asset allocation principles and spreading your portfolio among stocks and bonds, you can mitigate the risk of capital loss and reduce overall portfolio volatility without sacrificing significant gains.

ETFs which hold large portfolios of hundreds or even thousands of assets, play an important role in achieving diversification. When you invest in an ETF, you inherently reduce portfolio risk compared to holding only a few individual stocks.

You can also easily fine-tune your exposure to different asset classes with just a handful of ETFs. This flexibility allows you to create a customized mix of assets from various regions. Keep in mind that asset allocation is not an exact science; it varies for each investor based on risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon. For instance, conservative investors may prefer a higher percentage of bonds, while aggressive investors with a long time horizon might allocate more to stocks for greater returns. We'll look at some examples in the next section.

While a single ETF can provide plenty of diversification, I recommend considering a global approach. Many funds offer international exposure, enabling you to construct a truly diversified portfolio. As well, so-called "asset allocation" ETFs have become popular because they maintain a desirable mix of equities and fixed income in a single ETF. While asset allocation ETFs are convenient, they are more expensive to own and reduce your capacity for portfolio customization.

## Sample portfolio allocations of stocks and bonds

Creating an ETF portfolio that reflects your risk tolerance is key and we can easily achieve this by emphasizing two core components: stocks and bonds. As a general guideline, bonds tend to be safer and less volatile than stocks which offer higher returns but come with increased price volatility. Here are the main features of both:

1. **Bonds (Fixed Income)**
    - **Safety First**: Bonds are often considered the “safehouse” in a portfolio. They provide stability and income.
    - **Lower Risk, Lower Returns**: Bonds are generally less volatile than stocks. However, this safety comes at a cost: lower returns compared to stocks.
    - **Income Generation**: Bonds pay interest (called "coupon payments") regularly, making them suitable for income-focused investors.
    - **Capital Preservation**: Bonds help protect your capital during market downturns.
2. **Stocks (Equities)**
    - **Superior Returns Over the Long Haul**: Historically, equities have outperformed bonds over extended periods. They offer substantial returns.
    - **Higher Risk, Higher Returns**: Stocks are more volatile, but they can provide more growth than other assets.
    - **Ownership in Companies**: When you buy stocks, you become a partial owner of the underlying companies.
    - **Long-Term Perspective**: Equities thrive when held for the long haul, allowing you to benefit from compounding returns.

Both types of assets have desirable characteristics and a simple blend of these two types of assets can lay the foundation of your portfolio. Here are three sample ETF portfolios that offer a mix of each that you can use as a guide:

1. **Conservative**: This consists of 70% allocated to bonds and 30% in stocks. This portfolio focuses on stability, preservation of capital, and income generation. This approach is ideal for risk-averse investors or those with shorter investment horizons.
2. **Balanced**: A balanced approach is the traditional "60/40" portfolio. This is a mix of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, offering a mix of growth through equities and stability with fixed income. This mix is suitable if you're saving for a large purchase or are risk-averse.
3. **Growth**: For those willing to accept higher risk when aiming for higher returns, an 80% (or greater) allocation to stocks and a 20% (or less) allocation to bonds is a good target. If you have a very long investment horizon (decades), consider an "all-equity" (100%) portfolio built with globally diversified ETFs to maximize your returns.

Each portfolio should be tailored to your needs, and it's important to review and adjust the allocations periodically to align with changing market conditions and personal circumstances. In the next article, I’ll go into specific Canadian ETFs that provide exposure to bonds and equities, helping you construct a robust foundation for your investment journey.
