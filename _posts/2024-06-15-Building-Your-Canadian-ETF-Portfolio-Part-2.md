Creating a well-balanced ETF portfolio is a strategic endeavour. Like putting a puzzle together, it requires careful consideration of various pieces and their correlation to each other. In Part 1 of our journey, we covered the basics of ETF investing, explored major providers in Canada, and discussed the importance of asset allocation principles when building your own investment portfolio. In this article we'll differentiate active and passively managed ETFs and then get into specific ETFs to consider.

## Active and passive ETFs

Active managers aim to outperform the market by actively selecting investments (stocks, bonds, etc.) or rebalancing regularly (asset allocation ETFs). They rely on research, study companies or bonds, and make decisions based on their expertise. However, active funds come with higher costs due to research, trading, and management expenses. If successful, active managers generate excess returns (alpha) beyond market benchmarks.

While active ETFs regularly change their holdings, many equity and fixed income ETFs take a passive approach - they track market indices (e.g. S&P 500 or S&P/TSX 60) without active stock picking. These funds have minimal management fees since they don’t require extensive research. Passive investors aim to match market performance rather than beat it. ETFs and index funds provide broad diversification among asset classes.

**Choosing Your Path**:

- **Active**: If you believe in skilled managers and want a shot at beating the market.
- **Passive (Indexing)**: If you prefer simplicity, lower costs, and consistent market returns.

Now, let's get into some of the best of these portfolio building blocks.

## "One stop shop" - Asset allocation ETFs available in Canada

A globally diverse mix of stocks and bonds provides the foundation for a robust investment strategy. Imagine having this in a single holding - that is precisely what asset allocation ETFs provide.  Asset allocation ETFs are an excellent choice for investors who want a straightforward, diversified portfolio without the need to manage individual holdings. These are a form of active ETFs since they regularly rebalance on their own. They combine both stocks and bonds in a single fund and follow a predetermined allocation (say, a balanced portfolio of 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds) in order to match various risk profiles. Asset allocation ETFs are cost-effective and easy to maintain which led to their recent surge in popularity here in Canada. There are generally 4 flavours to choose from: conservative, balanced, growth, and all-equity portfolios.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the ticker symbols listed below are appended with ".TO" which means they are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This can be handy if you're searching for these ETFs on some websites; however you can drop the ".TO" when searching for them through your broker.

1. **Conservative ETF Portfolios**:

    - **Why**: Conservative portfolios prioritize stability, capital preservation, and income generation. They achieve this by holding a significant portion of bonds. These portfolios are ideal for risk-averse investors or those with shorter investment horizons.
    - **Approximate risk level**: Low
    - **Consider**: BMO Conservative ETF (ZCON.TO, MER = 0.20%), iShares Core Conservative Balanced ETF Portfolio (XCNS.TO, MER - 0.20%), Vanguard Conservative ETF Portfolio (VCNS.TO, MER = 0.22%)

2. **Balanced ETF Portfolios**:

    - **Why**: Balanced portfolios strike a harmonious chord between growth and stability. They hold a blend of stocks and bonds, making them suitable for various investors—whether you’re saving for a major purchase or prefer a balanced approach to investing.
    - **Approximate risk level**: Low to Medium
    - **Consider**: BMO Balanced ETF (ZBAL.TO, MER = 0.20%), iShares Core Balanced ETF Portfolio (XBAL.TO, MER = 0.20%), and Vanguard Balanced ETF Portfolio (VBAL.TO, MER = 0.24%).

    - [Balanced ETF Portfolio (VBAL)](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/products/products-group/etfs/VBAL)
3. **Growth ETF Portfolios**

    - **Why**: A growth-oriented portfolio aims for higher growth (of course), making it suitable for investors with medium-high risk tolerance and a longer investment time horizon.
    - **Approximate risk level**: Medium
    - **Consider**: BMO Growth ETF (ZGRO.TO, MER = 0.20%), iShares Core Growth ETF Portfolio (XGRO.TO, MER = 0.20%), and Vanguard Growth ETF Portfolio (VGRO.TO, MER = 0.24%).

    - [Growth ETF Portfolio (VGRO)](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/products/products-group/etfs/VGRO)
4. **All-Equity ETF Portfolios**

    - **Why**: An all-equity portfolio is exactly what it sounds like—100% invested in globally diversified stocks. The rationale for investing in these ETFs is that equities tend to outperform bonds and cash in the long run. These are suitable for investors who are comfortable with market volatility but are not recommended for short-term goals or risk-averse investors.
    - **Approximate risk level**: Medium to High
    - **Consider**: BMO All-Equity ETF (ZEQT.TO, MER = 0.20%), iShares Core Equity ETF Portfolio (XEQT.TO, MER = 0.20%), and Vanguard All-Equity ETF Portfolio (VEQT.TO, MER = 0.24%).

The asset allocation ETFs we’ve explored serve as excellent one-stop shops, providing a solid core for your investment strategy. However, there are compelling reasons to consider a more hands-on approach. Some investors prefer fine-tuning their portfolio by adjusting the mix of stocks and bonds. This customization allows alignment with specific risk tolerances, investment goals, and market conditions. While asset allocation ETFs are convenient, they come with slightly higher expense ratios. By constructing your own portfolio using passive index ETFs, you can reduce costs and retain more of your returns.

In our next section, we’ll jump into some of the best equity and fixed income index ETFs — the building blocks for DIY investors. These versatile tools empower you to tailor your portfolio while keeping expenses in check.

## Passive equity (stocks) ETFs available in Canada

Let's explore some of the best equity ETFs available in Canada that can be used to build your portfolio:

    - **Consider**: Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF (VFV.TO, MER = 0.09%) and BMO S&P 500 Index ETF (ZSP.TO, MER = 0.09%), iShares Core S&P 500 Index ETF (XUS.TO, MER = 0.09%).

3. **FTSE Developed Markets ETFs (International equity)**:

    - **Why**: Diversification beyond North America by including companies from Europe, Australia, and other developed regions.
    - **Benefits**: Geographic spread, exposure to global economic growth, and risk mitigation.
    - **Consider**: Vanguard FTSE Developed All Cap ex North America Index CAD-hedged ETF (VI.TO, MER = 0.22%) and BMO MSCI EAFE Index ETF (ZEA, MER = 0.22%).

4. **Emerging Markets ETFs (International equity)**:

    - **Why**: Tap into the growth of developing economies (e.g., China, India, Brazil).
    - **Benefits**: High growth prospects, but higher volatility.
    - **Consider**: Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets All Cap Index ETF (VEE.TO, MER = 0.25%) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets IMI Index ETF (ZEM.TO, MER = 0.28%).
    - **Links:**

5. **Real Estate ETFs (Alternative equity)**:
    - **Why**: Hedge against inflation, stable income through dividends, and exposure to the real estate sector.
    - **Benefits**: Diversification, capital appreciation, and income generation.
    - **Consider**: Vanguard FTSE Canadian Capped REIT Index ETF (VRE.TO, MER = 0.39%) and iShares S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index ETF (XRE.TO, MER = 0.61%).

    - [iShares S&P/TSX Capped REIT Index ETF | XRE](https://www.blackrock.com/ca/investors/en/products/239843/)
6. **Gold and Commodities ETFs (Commodities)**:
    - **Why**: Non-correlated asset class that performs differently from stocks and bonds.
    - **Benefits**: Traditionally seen as a "safe haven" during market downturns or inflationary periods.
    - **Consider**: Royal Canadian Mint CDN Gold Reserves (MNT.TO, MER = 0.35%) and Sprott Physical Gold and Silver Trust (CEF.TO, MER = 0.51%).
    - **Links:**
    - [Sprott Physical Gold and Silver Trust](https://www.sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-bullion-trusts/cef/)
    - [Canadian Gold Reserves – Royal Canadian Mint](https://www.reserves.mint.ca/Tsx_Gold/)

The list above is somewhat organized in order of priority for building an equity portfolio. The S&P 500 is foundational building block which performs consistently well, while the Canadian market features a robust financials and energy sector with low fees. Investing in the U.S. and Canada is a great start but focusing on two countries is too narrow in our diversified world.

Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need all of these assets and the expense ratios tend to creep up as we look to international and alternative assets. Canadian investors can start by focusing on building a base of equities that track the S&P 500 and S&P/TSX 60 then look to expand into other asset classes.

## Passive fixed income (bonds) ETFs available in Canada

When it comes to fixed income investing, bond ETFs offer simplicity and effectiveness. Here are some top choices to consider:

1. **BMO Aggregate Bond Index ETF (ZAG.TO, MER = 0.09%)**:
    - Focus: Broad exposure to Canadian investment-grade bonds.
    - Benefits: Low risk, stable income, and liquidity.
    - [BMO Aggregate Bond Index ETF ZAG](https://www.bmogam.com/ca-en/products/exchange-traded-fund/bmo-aggregate-bond-index-etf-zag/)
1. **Vanguard Canadian Aggregate Bond Index ETF (VAB.TO, MER = 0.09%)**:
    - Focus: Broad exposure to Canadian investment-grade bonds.
    - Key Features: Low risk, stable income, and liquidity.
    - [Canadian Aggregate Bond Index ETF (VAB)](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/products/products-group/etfs/VAB)
1. **Vanguard Canadian Short-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF (VSC.TO, MER = 0.11%)**:
    - Focus: Short-term corporate bonds.
    - Benefits: Diversity, higher yield, and liquidity.
    - [Canadian Short-Term Corporate Bond Index ETF (VSC)](https://www.vanguard.ca/en/investor/products/products-group/etfs/VSC)

Remember, bond ETFs provide diversification, liquidity, and flexibility. Choose an allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals.

## Considering factor ETFs, or "adding spice, to taste"

Now that we’ve covered the basics of common ETFs, let’s delve into a newer breed of active ETFs gaining popularity: Factor ETFs. These ETFs track assets with specific characteristics, such as high dividend yield, momentum, low volatility, quality, and value. While a full discussion is beyond the scope of this article, let’s briefly explore the main factors so you can make informed choices among the additional ETF options available.

1. **High Dividend Yield**:
    - These ETFs track companies that consistently pay out higher dividends.
    - Ideal for investors seeking a steady income stream.
2. **Momentum**:
    - Focus on stocks that have been increasing in price.
    - Expectations are that this upward trend will continue.
3. **Low Volatility**:
    - Composed of stocks with lower price swings.
    - Attractive to risk-averse investors.
4. **Quality**:
    - Select stocks based on indicators of financial health (e.g., stable earnings, low debt).
    - Aim for consistent, reliable performance.
5. **Value**:
    - Invest in undervalued stocks, offering a margin of safety.
    - Contrarian approach—seeking hidden gems.

```markdown
## Additional Notes on Factor ETFs:
High dividend yield ETFs, for instance, track companies that consistently pay out higher dividends, which can provide a steady income stream for investors. Momentum ETFs, on the other hand, focus on stocks that have been increasing in price, with the expectation that they will continue to do so. Low volatility ETFs are composed of stocks with lower price swings, appealing to those who wish to minimize risk. Quality ETFs select stocks based on indicators of a company's financial health, like stable earnings and low debt. Lastly, value ETFs aim to invest in stocks that are undervalued by the market, offering growth. Each of these strategies caters to different investor profiles and goals, allowing for a tailored approach to portfolio construction.
```

When considering such ETFs, it's important to look at their historical performance, but also to understand the methodology behind the index they track and the risks involved. Diversification with different types of ETFs can help mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the putative benefits each type offers. Note that there are many ways to slice up an index (e.g. ESG and RAFI) and this is by no means a complete list of factors. For those interested in exploring these options, resources like [Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/etfs/default.aspx) provide tools and research to help investors find ETFs that meet their specific criteria.

## Putting it all together

Investing in ETFs provides a powerful way to construct a diversified investment portfolio with mixed asset classes. By grasping the fundamentals, selecting reputable providers, and strategically allocating assets, Canadian investors can effectively manage their wealth to reach their financial objectives.

Remember these key points:

1. **Periodic Review**: Regularly assess and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation. Market shifts can alter the balance over time.
2. **Cost Awareness**: Be mindful of management fees and expense ratios associated with each ETF. These costs impact overall returns.
3. **Thoughtful Selection**: Choose a mix of ETFs aligned with your investment goals and risk tolerance. A well-crafted portfolio can capitalize on global opportunities while managing risk.
4. **Balance Matters**: Successful ETF investing lies in striking the right balance between diversification and concentration. Ensure your portfolio is resilient against market fluctuations.

Lastly, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor to tailor your investment strategy to your unique circumstances.
