## Biography

I received a Ph.D. in analytical chemistry from the University of Victoria (2017) where I specialized in real-time mass spectrometry method development for air-sensitive reactions. I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Glasgow where I gained experience in machine learning, statistical modelling, automated synthesis, and ion mobility separation of polyoxometalates (2017-2019).

My areas of expertise include LCMS, metabolomics, molecular networking, laboratory automation, data analytics, and developing analytical methodologies to optimize complex chemical reactions. Outside of chemistry, I enjoy developing data-driven asset-allocation strategies for investors, programming analytics projects in Python, and listening to new and interesting electronic music.
